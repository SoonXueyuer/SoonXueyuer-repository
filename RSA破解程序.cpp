    TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
    RSA 破解程序
    TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

    破解原理：
    1. 分解 n = p * q，找到素因子 p 和 q
    2. 计算欧拉函数 φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)
    3. 暴力求私钥 d，使得 (e * d) ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))
    4. 对每个密文 c 使用 m = c^d (mod n) 解密

    适用场景：小规模 RSA（n < 10^6）
